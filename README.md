## Welcome to Ruby's Markdown Page...

I am practicing using **Markdown** on this page by writing out a _recipe_.

Each commit will update the Github Page [here](https://rubyspch.github.io/jekyll-demo/). The Jekyll theme used was selected in the respository settings and is stated in the `_config.yml` configuration file.
