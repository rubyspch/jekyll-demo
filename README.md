## Welcome to Ruby's Markdown Page...

I am practicing using **Markdown** on this page by writing out a _recipe_.

Each commit will update the Github Page [here](https://rubyspch.github.io/jekyll-demo/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rubyspch/jekyll-demo/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
